# Electricity-Consumption-Segmentation-and-Prediction

## Project
In this project, we were given a dataset which provided daily electricity usage for 6445 houses
and companies between 2009 and 2010. The purpose of the project was to group customers
with similar electricity consumption behavior, analyze their behavior and predict loads
consumption of each cluster.
